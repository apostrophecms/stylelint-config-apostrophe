## Unreleased

## [1.0.1] - 2021-02-24

- Allows prefixed properties for `appearance`. `-moz-appearance` and `-webkit-appearance` are commonly used for button and select styling since they can't be auto-prefixed easily.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-01-27

### Added

- Initial release of an ApostropheCMS team stylelint configuration. This is based on `stylelint-config-punkave` rules, with additional scripts for keeping up to date with the standard stylelint config.
